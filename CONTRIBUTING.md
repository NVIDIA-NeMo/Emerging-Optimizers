# Contributing To Emerging-Optimizers

## Dependency

Use [abseil-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py/tree/main)'s **logging**, **testing** and **flags** instead of Python's own **logging**, **unittest** and **argparse**.

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing dependencies. For reproducible builds, our project tracks the generated `uv.lock` file in the repository.
On a weekly basis, the CI attemps an update of the lock file to test against upstream dependencies.

New required dependencies can be added by `uv add $DEPENDENCY`.

New optional dependencies can be added by `uv add --optional --extra $EXTRA $DEPENDENCY`.

`EXTRA` refers to the subgroup of extra-dependencies to which you're adding the new dependency.
Example: For adding a TRT-LLM specific dependency, run `uv add --optional --extra trtllm $DEPENDENCY`.

New dependencies to a dependency group can be added with `uv add --group $GROUP $DEPENDENCY`. Dependency groups are specific to uv and are also optional dependencies but not intended to be used with the package such as docs dependencies.

Alternatively, the `pyproject.toml` file can also be modified directly.

Adding a new dependency will update UV's lock-file. Please check this into your branch:

```bash
git add uv.lock pyproject.toml
git commit -m "build: Adding dependencies"
git push
```

### ðŸ§¹ Linting and Formatting

We use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting. CI does not auto-fix linting and formatting issues, but most issues can be fixed by running the following command:

```bash
uv run ruff check --fix .
uv run ruff format .
```

## Coding Style

We generally follow [Google's style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) , with some exceptions:

* Line length extended to 120 for Python and 100 for C++ code.
* Common use in PyTorch, which are prohibited by Google style, are allowed, including but not limited to:
  * Import function, class, not just module
  * Some special variable name, `x`, `dX`, etc.
* Allow common capitalized naming in Triton code.

Although common, **mixed case is not allowed** in any code.

Run pre-commit at local before submitting merge request. You can also read [.pre-commit-config.yaml]( .pre-commit-config.yaml) to understand what are being forced. The **flake8** and **mypy** settings are inherited from PyTorch.

## Test

All tests should be placed under [tests](tests). We aim for 100% test coverage for this tiny project.

We use [abseil-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py/tree/main) **testing** because it is easier to launch multi process than alternatives.

## Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
