    r"""One step of an online solver for the orthogonal Procrustes problem.

    The orthogonal Procrustes problem is :math:`\min_U \| U Q - I \|_F` s.t. :math:`U^H U = I`
    by rotating Q as :math:`\exp(a R) Q`, where :math:`R = Q^H - Q` is the generator and :math:`\|a R\| < 1`.

    If using 2nd order expansion, `max_step_size` should be less than :math:`1/4` as we only expand :math:`\exp(a R)`
    to its 2nd order term. If using 3rd order expansion, `max_step_size` should be less than :math:`5/8`.
    This method is an expansion of a Lie algebra parametrized rotation that
    uses a simple approximate line search to find the optimal step size, from Xi-Lin Li.

    Args:
        Q: Tensor of shape (n, n), general square matrix to orthogonalize.
        max_step_size: Maximum step size for the line search. Default is 1/8. (0.125)
        eps: Small number for numerical stability.
        order: Order of the Taylor expansion. Must be 2 or 3. Default is 2.
