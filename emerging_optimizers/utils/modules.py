    """Conv1d with weights+bias stored in a single 2D tensor

    There are conv1d used in some LLM, in mamba mixer for example. Because the weight is not 2d, we cannot apply
    many of the emerging optimizers originally introduced for 2d weights of Linear layers without bias. Since
    convolution can be viewed as a matrix multiplication with im2col (either implicit or explicit), we can flatten
    the weight into a single 2D tensor and then apply the emerging optimizers to it.

    Bias is not commonly used in most LLM's anymore, but they are often included in this type of conv1d.
    Since bias is mathematically the 0 order term of the polynomial, we can combine weight and bias into a
    single 2D tensor.

    Arguments are the same as ::class:`torch.nn.Conv1d`.

    Note:
        This implementation potentially introduces a small overhead because of split weights can combining gradients
        of it. This should be trivial compared to computational cost of LLM training. If it becomes a concern, a
        kernel can be developed to eliminate the overhead.

    Note:
        Similar flattening logic can be applied to N-D convolution. But since we don't have use cases of them in LLM
        yet, they are not supported despite the __init__() function is generalized enough to support N-D convolution.
